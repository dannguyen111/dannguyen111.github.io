        <p>
          In January 2024, I founded the Gettysburg College Fashion Initiative to empower students to express
          themselves, leading a <strong>10-member executive board</strong> across five distinct departments.

          Beyond just "fashion," this organization served as a major operational challenge that honed my leadership
          skills outside of the technical realm. It required managing large budgets, coordinating logistics for hundreds
          of attendees, and fostering a creative community.
